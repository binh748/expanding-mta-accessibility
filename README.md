Metis nyc20_ds24 project 1 (team 7: Binh, Eliza, Meehir, Ramon, Tolu)

**Project description:** For those with mobility issues, non-ADA compliant NYC subway stations pose both a danger and an extra financial burden. Falls are an unfortunate possibility, and the inability to use the subway can leave to more expensive transportation options.

We identify 5 Manhattan subway stations that would most benefit from elevator installation using the below data sources: 

* MTA turnstile data
* demographic information from the 2018 5-year American Community Survey (ACS)
* Google Maps API
